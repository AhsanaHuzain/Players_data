# Players_data
"A data analysis of basketball players using Python."
To analyze this data, I used the Python programming language. I employed various libraries and modules to perform the analysis and visualization, which provided numerous insights. Specifically, libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib significantly simplified the visualization process. Using these libraries, I identified trends in player performance, visualized predominant age groups, and analyzed the relationships between age and salary.

Steps in Data Analysis
Data Correction:

Corrected the data in the "height" column by replacing it with random numbers between 150 and 180 using the random module.
Team Distribution:

Determined the distribution of employees across each team and calculated the percentage split relative to the total number of employees.
Position Segregation:

Segregated employees based on their positions within the company.
Age Group Analysis:

Identified the predominant age group among employees.
Salary Expenditure:

Discovered which team and position have the highest salary expenditure.
Correlation Between Age and Salary:

Investigated if there’s any correlation between age and salary, and represented it visually.
Insights from the Analysis
Team Distribution:

The graph shows that the New Orleans Pelicans have just over 4% of employees, while the Orlando Magic and Minnesota Timberwolves have just under 1%. Other teams appear relatively even in their distribution of employees, suggesting a fairly uniform spread across different teams.
Position Distribution:

The actual counts verify that shooting guards (SG) and power forwards (PF) have comparable numbers. Point guards (PG) are greater in number than small forwards (SF) and centers (C), but somewhat lower than SG and PF. The least represented positions are C and SF.
Predominant Age Group:

The predominant age group among employees is 24 years old, with 47 individuals, indicating a significant interest among young adults in basketball.
Age Distribution:

The plot shows a right-skewed distribution, peaking sharply at age 24 and gradually declining afterward. Ages below 24 are less common, while there’s a rapid increase in density up to 24. Ages above 24 show a more gradual decline, suggesting a steady decrease in frequency as age increases.
Age and Salary Relationship:

The graph indicates that salary generally increases with age, with a significant peak between ages 35 and 40, suggesting that professionals in this age range tend to earn the most. However, a sharp drop after this peak may indicate factors such as retirement or career shifts.
Salary Expenditure by Team and Position:

The Los Angeles Lakers (SF) have the highest salary expenditure, allocating significant resources to small forwards. This may reflect an emphasis on star players or key contributors in that position.
For instance, Kobe Bryant, a small forward for the Los Angeles Lakers, earned approximately $25,000,000 at around 37 years old, reflecting his extensive experience and exceptional skills as a player.
