# Players_data
"A data analysis of basketball players using Python."
To analyze this data, I used the Python programming language. I employed various libraries and modules to perform the analysis and visualization, which provided numerous insights. Specifically, libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib significantly simplified the visualization process. Using these libraries, I identified trends in player performance, visualized predominant age groups, and analyzed the relationships between age and salary.
